              <p class="">During Unit 1, I delved into key principles for creating secure software, analyzing the shortcomings of conventional development methods like Waterfall and the advantages of contemporary approaches such as Agile. The flexibility and iterative nature of Agile make it the preferred choice for secure, dynamic software environments while promoting a collaborative and responsive development process.<br>
              I was also introduced to the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an effective tool for designing software systems using standardized diagrams. As part of our group work, I utilized Umbrello, an open-source UML tool, to create a flowchart illustrating steps that lead to a common security vulnerability identified by OWASP. This exercise demonstrated how UML can simplify complex design elements, aiding in the visualization of system interactions and ensuring accurate representation of secure software models.<br>
              Unit 1 also emphasized the importance of cultivating a risk-aware culture within organizations. I discovered that while developing secure software is crucial, it's equally vital to foster an environment where developers and stakeholders actively identify and address risks. Establishing this culture is fundamental for maintaining secure development practices throughout the software lifecycle.<br>
              Lastly, this unit included the formation of our project team. We set up <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit01/Collaboration%20evidences/WhatsAppgroup.jpg">a WhatsApp Group</a> for daily communication, signed <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit01/Collaboration%20evidences/Team%20Contract.pdf">Team Contract</a>, and created a shared <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit01/Collaboration%20evidences/Google_drive.PNG">Google Drive folder</a> for collaborative work. This initial organization lays the groundwork for a successful team project by ensuring clear communication, shared responsibilities, and easily accessible resources.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">In Unit 2, I developed skills in UML modeling to enhance secure system design within the Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This unit emphasized the role of UML diagrams and flowcharts as essential tools for effective communication among stakeholders, beginning in the design phase and supporting development throughout the process.<br>
            A key focus of this unit was integrating security practices at each stage of the Agile SDLC. I explored best practices that proactively address security vulnerabilities by embedding protective measures in every phase of development. To build on this, I engaged in hands-on practice with UML diagrams that represent secure system structures and workflows. These included use case diagrams to map user interactions, sequence diagrams detailing step-by-step workflows, activity diagrams highlighting user actions, and class diagrams outlining the relationships, attributes, and methods involved in the system architecture. Each of these modeling techniques helped me visualize how security considerations influence the design and functionality of software systems.<br>
            To further understand the standards that guide secure system planning, I studied ISO/IEC guidelines on software security, with a particular focus on the ISO/IEC 27000 series. Familiarity with this industry-standard terminology and framework allowed me to apply consistent security principles in my UML models and to better understand the language that underpins secure software development.<br>
            As part of this week’s seminar, I contributed to a discussion on the Scrum security review by <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit02/Seminar2_Question1_Table.pdf">creating a table</a> that mapped security recommendations to each stage of the Scrum agile lifecycle, referencing Sharma and Bawa’s research on secure agile development. This exercise highlighted specific security tasks relevant to each Scrum stage, emphasizing the importance of building robust, secure software from the outset. I also wrote a <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit02/Seminar2_Question2_BlogPost.pdf">blog post</a> on managing insider cybersecurity risks, drawing on five key terms from ISO/IEC 27000 Section 3. This activity reinforced the idea that managing human factors is crucial to achieving effective cybersecurity, illustrating that technology alone cannot create a secure environment.<br>
            Throughout the week, I also engaged with my peers by participating in three reviews, providing feedback on their UML diagrams and their approaches to security within the Agile SDLC. You can access it by clicking 'EXPLORE UNIT'S ARTEFACTS' below. On November 2nd, our team held its first online meeting via Google Meet <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opSY1JQdYs">(a link to record)</a>, where we discussed several secure application domains <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit02/Teamwork/Domain.pdf">(summary of pros & cons)</a> and ultimately selected Online Retailer as our project focus <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit02/Teamwork/Vote.PNG">(vote results)</a>. Online meeting <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit02/Teamwork/Agenda.pdf">agenda</a>. We organized our tasks on a <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/busilas/SSD_UoE/blob/main/Unit02/Teamwork/Trello.PNG">Trello board</a> and set up a schedule for weekly meetings every Sunday at 11 AM (UK time) to ensure regular updates and collaborative progress.<br>
            In summary, Unit 2 provided me with practical experience in UML modeling, a deeper understanding of ISO/IEC standards, and a comprehensive view of security within the Agile SDLC. These skills will be invaluable in communicating secure design principles and implementing them effectively throughout our team project.</p>

              <p class="mb-4">In Unit 3, I explored the history, key concepts, and design principles behind modern programming languages. We examined milestones from early machine code to languages like COBOL and Python, understanding how foundational figures like Alan Turing influenced language evolution. Using Python, I applied essential programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, deepening my grasp of object-oriented programming (OOP).</br>
              The unit emphasized secure coding practices and common vulnerabilities, using tools like Pylint for code quality checks. I conducted hands-on exercises comparing buffer overflow handling in C and Python, revealing Python’s memory safety advantages. Implementing a producer-consumer model with thread synchronization showed how queues prevent data loss and duplication in concurrent programming.</br>
              Our team discussions centered on secure programming, comparing Python and C for OS development and exploring ways to enhance the security of the producer-consumer model. We held an online meeting to share insights, which deepened my understanding of security principles and the benefits of various programming languages in different contexts. This unit enhanced my understanding of programming language history, essential design concepts, and the importance of secure development practices.</br>
              During the unit, I collaborated with my peers during our second team meeting on November 17th, where we worked on developing a secure software development design document.

              <p class="mb-4">This unit focused on two key programming concepts: regular expressions (RegEx) and recursion, and their implications for system security. The activities and discussions provided valuable insights into the practical applications, benefits, and challenges of these concepts.</br>
              I explored how RegEx can serve as a powerful tool for tasks like data validation, parsing, and text search. However, I also examined the security risks it introduces, particularly Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) attacks caused by problematic patterns known as "Evil Regex." Through these discussions, I learned strategies to mitigate such risks, including simplifying patterns, implementing timeouts, and pre-testing expressions for safety and efficiency.</br>
            The concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve problems such as sorting, searching, or traversing data structures, was another area of focus. While recursion offers an elegant solution to many programming challenges, I analyzed how improper implementation could lead to risks like stack overflow. Implementing proper safeguards, such as defining clear base cases and considering tail recursion optimization, were identified as critical measures for secure and efficient use.</br>
          Understanding the security implications of these concepts was a significant part of this unit. I gained insight into how inefficient or overly complex implementations of RegEx or recursion could lead to vulnerabilities, such as system performance degradation or denial-of-service risks. This knowledge helped me learn to balance security requirements with the functionality provided by these tools.</br>
          Collaboration was an integral part of this unit. During our third online team meeting on November 24th, we worked on developing a secure software development design document. The recording of this meeting is available here <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFd9rZu24HA">(a link to record)</a>.</br>

These techniques highlighted the various ways in which software security can be breached and how to mitigate such risks effectively.</br>
              One of the highlights of this unit was the exploration of Python tools for automated testing, such as logical and stylistic linters. The focus on security-related tools, like Bandit, allowed me to understand how these frameworks support effective and secure coding practices. From a practical standpoint, I worked with equivalence partitioning through the equivalence.py implementation, which demonstrated how sets of data can be partitioned into equivalence classes for testing purposes. This exercise enabled me to investigate and experiment with testing methods, deepening my understanding of the concepts.</br>
              Another engaging topic was the relevance of cyclomatic complexity in modern software testing. I evaluated its importance in assessing code design and its applicability in the development of secure software. This discussion involved justifying opinions and sharing insights with my team, further enhancing my critical analysis skills in the context of secure development.</br>
              This unit equipped me with the knowledge and skills to systematically manage security risks as part of a software development project.

              <p class="mb-4">During this week, I delved into the world of linters, powerful tools available in Python for ensuring the development of high-quality and secure code. Linters play a vital role in identifying potential errors, enforcing coding standards, and improving code consistency, all of which are essential for producing professional and secure software.</br>
              I explored the purpose and functionality of popular linters such as Pylint, Flake8, and McCabe, each offering unique insights into code quality and maintainability. Pylint helped us identify errors and enforce best practices, Flake8 provided a streamlined check for style issues and errors, and McCabe assessed cyclomatic complexity to evaluate code maintainability. By running these tools on different scripts, I gained hands-on experience in identifying and correcting errors, as well as simplifying code structures to reduce complexity.</br>
              In addition to individual tasks, our team collaborated effectively throughout the week. We met online on December 1st and maintained continuous communication via WhatsApp. Together, we finalized the assessment "Development Team Project: Design Document” and completed a peer review of the document. Click 'SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT 1' below to access our team design document.</br>
              By the end of this unit, I developed a strong understanding of how linters contribute to creating error-free and consistent Python code. Applying these tools in real-world projects not only enhances code quality but also ensures security. This was particularly significant for the secure CRUD-functional RESTful API we proposed for internet forensics. You can access my team’s design document by clicking 'EXPLORE UNIT'S ARTEFACTS'.</p>

              <p class="mb-4">This week, I explored the fundamental concepts of operating systems (OS) and their critical relationships with programming languages and software security. Operating systems are the backbone of most applications, providing essential functions such as handling user inputs, managing processes, and facilitating interactions with software libraries. These interactions, while integral to functionality, introduce security implications that need careful consideration.</br>
              The unit covered several key topics, including the types and functions of typical operating systems, the differences between processes, threads, and schedulers, and approaches to enhancing OS security. I also gained insight into the distinctions between static and dynamic libraries and how these differences affect software design and implementation.</br>
              One of the activities involved creating a simple command-line interface (CLI) shell using Python. This shell could perform basic tasks such as listing directory contents, adding numbers, and displaying available commands. I analyzed the shell for potential security vulnerabilities and proposed improvements, including enhanced input validation to mitigate risks.</br>
              Additionally, I worked on developing a RESTful API for a distributed environment. Using Python’s Flask library, I implemented an API to manage user records, allowing for creation, deletion, and modification of user data. Running and testing the API provided insights into how libraries like Flask enable seamless web-based interactions while highlighting the importance of secure API design.</br>
              This unit also introduced the concept of ontologies and their relevance to software systems. I explored the definition of an ontology and considered its application to the secure CRUD-functional RESTful API my team is designing for the summative assessment.</br>
              By the end of this unit, I had a comprehensive understanding of operating systems, their role in software development, and the associated security considerations. These insights are directly applicable to my project, ensuring that we create a robust and secure solution.

              <p class="mb-4">This week focused on the principles and applications of cryptography, emphasizing its integration with operating systems and its role in securing modern systems. Cryptography serves as a critical component in protecting data, ensuring privacy, and maintaining the integrity of systems and communications.</br>
              I explored the fundamental concepts of cryptography, including common cryptographic libraries and their applications. The unit provided a case study on how cryptographic techniques are applied to operating systems, highlighting their importance in securing data exchanges and system interactions. Additionally, I created a basic Python application that leveraged cryptographic libraries to encode sample data, further solidifying my understanding of these technologies.</br>
              As part of the portfolio component, I participated in the second collaborative discussion of the module, which focused on the case study of “TrueCrypt.” This discussion delved into the tool’s security vulnerabilities and the potential risks users might face. I also considered the role of ontology in identifying key vulnerabilities and mitigating risks, which was essential for understanding how cryptographic systems can be designed to enhance security.</br>
              In the seminar activity, I developed a Python program that encrypts text files using a selected cryptographic algorithm. I chose the algorithm based on its strength and ease of implementation, ensuring compliance with modern security standards. The program demonstrated how encryption could safeguard data, and I evaluated whether the chosen algorithm met GDPR requirements. This involved justifying how the encryption process aligns with the regulation's emphasis on data privacy and security by design.</br>
              By the end of this unit, I gained practical experience in using cryptographic libraries, understanding their pros and cons, and applying them to real-world scenarios. These insights are critical for creating secure systems that adhere to data protection regulations such as GDPR.

              <p class="mb-4">This week was a significant step forward in building practical Python development skills, focusing on creating APIs to support distributed environments. APIs serve as a bridge between the back-end and user interfaces, enabling efficient interaction with systems while adhering to security and best coding practices.</br>
              The primary focus of this unit was to create an API using Python’s Flask library, providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for managing records. I designed and implemented an API that allowed for creating and reading records from a relational SQL database. This hands-on exercise deepened my understanding of Flask’s functionalities, including how to handle requests and ensure secure data processing.</br>
              Beyond the technical implementation, I reflected on the utility of ontologies in supporting distributed architectures. Ontologies help standardize service deployments by providing a structured framework for understanding and organizing data relationships. This understanding is particularly valuable in creating APIs that are scalable and maintainable in distributed environments.</br>
              In addition to the technical tasks, I contributed to the second collaborative discussion on the “TrueCrypt” case study. Reviewing and providing feedback on my peers’ posts offered an opportunity to engage critically with different perspectives on cryptographic vulnerabilities and their implications.</br>
              By the end of this unit, I was able to design a secure, functional API and appreciate the importance of ontologies in distributed systems. These skills and insights are directly applicable to my summative assessment project, where back-end and API development are key components.

              <p class="mb-4">This week provided a comprehensive exploration of modern system architectures, from traditional monolithic deployments to distributed systems, microservices, virtualization, and containers. These architectures represent the evolution of computing systems, reflecting the growing demand for scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. However, with these advancements comes an increased attack surface, necessitating robust security measures to protect sensitive data and system integrity.</br>
              I analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures, focusing on the challenges posed by distributed systems. As systems become more decentralized, ensuring secure communication across distributed components becomes critical. Techniques such as encryption and secure key distribution were examined to address these challenges. Additionally, I studied the unique vulnerabilities of virtualized environments and the methods needed to mitigate specific threats in these contexts.</br>
              As part of this unit, I reviewed the article by Schmitz et al. (2016) on faceted data as a method to prevent data leakage. This approach involves creating controlled views of sensitive data to limit exposure, a technique that aligns with the principle of least privilege. I evaluated the pros and cons of faceted data: while it offers a robust method for minimizing data leakage, it requires careful implementation and performance considerations to avoid bottlenecks or excessive complexity.</br>
              I also designed a basic outline in Python for implementing a faceted data system, demonstrating how controlled access could be enforced programmatically. This exercise provided practical insights into the challenges and benefits of managing data access in distributed and virtualized environments.</br>
              By the end of this unit, I gained a deeper understanding of how system architectures have evolved and the security implications of these changes. I also expanded my knowledge of encryption techniques and data leakage prevention, which are vital in building secure, distributed systems.
